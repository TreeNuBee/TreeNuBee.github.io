# Parkinson's Simulation VR Project

The purpose of this project is to utilize the presence and immerse of virtual reality (VR) to simulate Parkinson's disease (PD).  By engaging students in the simulated daily life of patients with PD, we aim to help medical students to have hands-on experience of the disease and thus to facilitate their understanding of the symptoms and the empathy of patients.
